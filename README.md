Here's the updated `README.md` file with modifications to reflect your Electron and Next.js 14 application:

# My Electron-Next.js App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), integrated with Electron for building desktop applications.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server for Electron and Next.js:

```bash
npm run dev:electron
```

Open the Electron application to see the result. The app will also be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser if required.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel (Optional for Web Version)

If you want to deploy only the web version of this application, the easiest way is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

This `README.md` now reflects the combined Electron and Next.js environment, focusing on the `npm run dev:electron` command for development.
